				      We offer four teams depending on distance and speed: (1) Powerful puppies (former little dogs), (2) Middle dogs, (3) Hybrids, and (4) Big dogs - your athlete can initially choose their team, and then we -the coaches- might rotate them around until they find a comfortable team. Pacers is NOT competitive, we get together to run and have fun while enjoying and taking care of the outdoors and ourselves.

      <h2>About Pacers</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="sectionWhite">
      <p>
      The Pacers is a non-profit youth running club that has been
      operational since the 1970s. Boys and girls aged 7&ndash;18 join
      the Pacers for a competitive edge, for exercise, or just for
      fun. Runners are grouped according to age and ability, with
      shorter runs tailored for beginners and more vigorous runs for
      seasoned veterans.  Our all-volunteer coaching staff offers
      creative sessions which aim to instill a love of running as a
      lifetime sport.
      </p>
      <p>
      Parents are always encouraged to join our runs!
      </p>
      <p>
      We offer spring and fall seasons. Both seasons include a mix of
      road and trail running, varied workouts, time trials, scavenger
      hunt and relay fun, and an end-of-season family party.  The fall
      season focuses more on trail running. The spring season focuses
      more on road running and also offers an opportunity to focus on
      sprinting, and an introduction to hurdles, baton relays and
      field events. Coaches offer tips on such topics as running form,
      stretching, and nutrition at the beginning and informally
      throughout practices.  Runners have the opportunity to join
      other Pacers in local races, but the emphasis is always on fun
      and participation with the Pacers&mdash;continually "on the run"
      since the 1970's!
      </p>
      <p>
	<b>Affiliations:</b>Pacers is a is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
	organization and a member of the USA Track and Field
	Association.
	<br><br>
	<b>Locations:</b> Pacers meet at various locations around
	Chapel Hill and Carrboro, depending on the season. Past
	meeting locations have included Wilson Park, Seawell
	elementary, McDougal middle school, and locations near UNC
	campus.
	<br><br>
	<b>Adverse weather:</b> If there are storms in the area, use
	your family judgement.  We do run in the rain, but not in
	heavy thunder/lightning. Generally, we'll try to make the call
	as to whether practice will go on as scheduled by 45 minutes
	prior to start at the latest and try to send an email, based
	on area Doppler weather data, but sometimes communication is
	not possible. If in doubt choose to stay home, or remain close
	by if you can, and know that we are watching the radar and
	moving runners to safety if the weather takes a turn for the
	worse during practice.
	<br><br>
	<b>Attire:</b> Runners must be appropriately attired in
	workout clothes and running shoes.  These shoes don't have to
	be high end, but they must be athletic shoes suitable for
	running (not basketball shoes).  We support Fleet Feet Sports
	in Carrboro as our running community resource!
	<br><br>
	<b>Hydration:</b> We have a cooler of Gatorade / sports drink
	available at the conclusion of each practice, but there's only
	so much to go around, so please have your Pacer also bring a
	water bottle with their name on it. The importance of daily
	hydration increases with rising temperatures.

      <h2>Registration</h2>
      <p>
	Boys and girls age 7 (or turning 7 during this current calendar
	year) through aged 18 are eligble to register. The price is $80 for one child or $150 for two siblings.
     </p>
     <p>
	Registration details are communicated to the parent email list
	prior to each season. Email ccpacers@gmail.com to join the list.
     </p>
     <p>
	Due to the overwhelming growth of the Pacers in recent years
	and the desire to sustain a safe and personalized program, we
	limit the number of runners who may participate each
	season. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis
	with returning runners having priority.

	      The Pacers is led by Head Coach Eimy Rivas Plata, and
	      welcomes veteran and new volunteer coaches including
	      parents, members of the UNC XC Club, and middle and high
	      school junior coaches.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Pacers culture enjoys and depends on the involvement of
	      Pacer families: parents, caregivers, siblings,
	      grandparents.  Not all are runners, but there are many
	      opportunities. Here are some of the many of the ways
	      family members support Pacers:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>sweep/run at practices on a regular or sporadic basis
	      <li>mix and bring Gatorade to practice one day a week (provided by Pacers)
	      <li>assist with organized activities like Time Trials, scavenger hunts or relays (with or without running)
	      <li>assist with distribution of Pacer Tees
	      <li>take photos of practices & events to share and celebrate Pacers' experiences
	      <li>assist with coordination of weekend events (optional races, USATF)
	      <li>assist with the preparation of PR ribbons
	      <li>help plan and coordinate end-of-season family celebration.

      <h2>Team Rules</h2>
      <p>
	Here are our "Rules of the Trails" for all participants,
	parents, and even coaches to study and practice.  Disregard
	for the rules will result in coaches speaking with parents,
	and repeated infractions will initiate the disciplinary
	sequence.
	<br><br>
	<b>ON-TIME DELIVERY</b>&mdash;Practices begin with a meet-up, including
	announcements, recognition, and the occasional guest
	speaker. Runners should arrive before the practice start time,
	and MUST be picked up by the practice end time. Runners
	arriving late should not be merely dropped off at the
	trailhead, as groups run workouts away from the meet-up area;
	<br><br>
	<b>A RUNNING CONCERN</b>&mdash;The CC Pacers is a running
	club. We understand that many Pacers will be adjusting to
	running workouts on the trails, and many will get into better
	shape in due time. As they are able, however, Pacers must be
	able to run at the group's pace. Walking or dawdling disrupts
	the group workout. Workouts are beginner-friendly but
	gradually intensify over the course of the season. If a runner
	is having a hard time keeping up with his / her group, please
	speak to a coach. Conversely, if a runner is intentionally
	walking or dawdling for attention, coaches will speak to the
	runner's parent and may initiate the disciplinary sequence;
	<br><br>
	<b>GROUP THERAPY</b>&mdash;Once Pacers are grouped together for
	workouts, runners must stay with their coaches until their
	coaches dismiss them or place them under the watchful eye of
	another coach;
	<br><br>
	<b>HORSEPOWER, NOT HORSEPLAY</b>&mdash;We are fortunate guests in the
	forest and UNC XC trails.  In past years, we've seen fence and
	tree climbing, wrestling, playing catch with water bottles,
	etc. The trails are a place for fun, but no horseplay will be
	tolerated;
	<br><br>
	<b>'LOTS' TO THINK ABOUT</b>&mdash;Traffic will be heavy in parking area
	as practice begins and ends. Pacers should stay out of the
	parking lot unless getting out of or into a car or being
	escorted away from the meet-up on a run by coaches. That said,
	motorists should watch for children (and adults!) darting out
	into traffic. No runners should cross ANY roadway unless
	directly under the supervision of a coach.
	<br><br>
	<b>KEEP IT CLEAN</b>&mdash;We are fortunate guests one the
	trails. Please leave the area better and cleaner than we've
	found it.
