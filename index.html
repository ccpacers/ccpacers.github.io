      <h2>About Pacers</h2>
      <p>
      Boys and girls aged 7&ndash;18 join the Pacers for a competitive
      edge, for exercise, or just for fun. Runners are grouped
      according to age and ability, with shorter runs tailored for
      beginners and more vigorous runs for seasoned veterans.
      Whatever your ability, our volunteer coach teams are looking
      forward to offering creative sessions which aim to instill a
      love of running as a lifetime sport.
      </p>
      <p>
      Parents are always welcome to join our runs!
      </p>
      <p>
      We offer spring and fall seasons. Both seasons include a mix of
      road and trail running, varied workouts, time trials for PRs,
      scavenger hunt & relay fun, and an end-of-season family party.
      The spring season also offers an opportunity to focus on
      sprinting, and an introduction to hurdles, baton relays and
      field events. Coaches offer tips on such topics as running form,
      stretching, and hydration & nutrition at the beginning and
      informally throughout practices.  Runners have the opportunity
      to join other Pacers in local races, but the emphasis is always
      on fun and participation with the Pacers&mdash;continually "on
      the run" since the 1970's!

      <h2>Registration</h2>
      <p>
	Youngsters age 7 (or turning 7 during this current calendar
	year) through aged 18 are eligble to register. The price is $75 for the
	first child, and $55 for additional siblings.
     </p>

	Due to the overwhelming growth of the Pacers in recent years
	and the desire to sustain a safe and personalized program, we
	limit the number of runners who may participate each
	season. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis
	with returning runners having priority.

	      The Pacers is led by Head Coach Eimy Rivas Plata, and
	      welcomes veteran and new volunteer coaches including
	      parents, members of the UNC XC Club, and middle and high
	      school junior coaches.

	      Pacers culture enjoys and depends on the involvement of
	      Pacer families: parents, caregivers, siblings,
	      grandparents.  Not all are runners, but there are many
	      opportunities. Here are some of the many of the ways
	      family members support Pacers:
	      <ul>
		<li>sweep/run at practices on a regular or sporadic basis
		<li>mix and bring Gatorade to practice one day a week (provided by Pacers)
		<li>assist with organized activities like Time Trials, scavenger hunts or relays (with or without running)
		<li>assist with distribution of Pacer Tees
		<li>take photos of practices & events to share and celebrate Pacers' experiences
		<li>assist with coordination of weekend events (optional races, USATF)
		<li>assist with the preparation of PR ribbons
		<li>help plan and coordinate end-of-season family celebration.
